# EasyChatDM - Demonstrates creating simple MCP Server tools

Example MCP Server tools for playing D&amp;D with generative AIs. These tools are oracles that are used to determine 
random yes/no questions but also descriptions, events, NPCs, etc. They are "random tables" to use when you want to 
introduce some uncertainty, twists and turns, and randomness to your gaming. This project is for educational
purposes so little attention is given to good code design.

These tools are MCP Server tools that will work with Claude desktop and other MCP Clients. They're written in
Spring AI MCP. This project is for education, so no consideration is given to good design. Instesd, the code is
written to make it easy to follow step-by-step how to create tools. See [the ChatDM project](https://github.com/cote/chatdm/tree/main)) for a more
complex, somewhat better designed version of this EasyChatDM.
