            When playing a role playing game, like D&D, it is useful to have Oracles to randomly
            determine what happens and come up with ideas. This tool gets a list of the named oracle 
            available, listing the name of the Oracle and how they could be used. Oracles in
            solo D&D serve as randomized decision-making tools that replace a human Dungeon Master, 
            allowing lone players to experience unpredictable gameplay. They generate impartial 
            responses to player questions, create emergent storytelling by introducing unexpected 
            elements, fill in world details like NPC motivations or location features, 
            make objective rulings on action success, and maintain game balance through 
            complications or twists. Ranging from simple yes/no probability tools to 
            complex tables and random event generators, oracles provide the genuine 
            surprise and challenge typically supplied by another person. By consulting 
            these systems at key decision points, solo players can avoid predetermined 
            outcomes and experience a dynamic narrative that unfolds organically rather 
            than following a scripted path they'd consciously or unconsciously create themselves.
            The names of oracles may be vague and if there is not a description available, you 
            should think on how to interpret them. Lastly, if there other other oracles available that
            are NOT named, prefer using those. for example, there is a tool called
            EasyChatDM_NPC_Motivations that you should use instead of a named oracle that
            determines NPC Motivations. Or not, you decide how crazy you want to be. Use both
