                    When playing Dungeons and Dragons (DnD), use this oracle tool to determine straight forward yes/no questions.
                    Deterministic answers are useful when you need a concrete response to move forward in the game.
                    The answers are on a gradient from strong no, no, weak no, weak yes, yes, and strong yes.
                    Use the degree (strong, weak, or just yes and no) to determine the degree to what happens. 
                    The strong it is, to more extreme the answer, etc.
                    Examples of oracle questions: 
                    (1) is there a goblins hiding in the bushes?
                    (2) does the merchant want to sell the cloak at a discount?
                    (3) does the planned for action happen in the adventure?
