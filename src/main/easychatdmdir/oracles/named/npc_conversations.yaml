NPC Conversations:
  description: >
    Use this table to generate spontaneous or pre-scripted NPC dialogue topics—especially useful in taverns, streets, downtime scenes, or during social events. Roll when a player strikes up conversation, listens in on chatter, or asks, “What are folks talking about?” Interpret the result as either the subject the NPC *wants* to discuss, or something they *accidentally reveal* while talking. Tailor tone by NPC type: a town crier may shout a current event, while a nervous shopkeep might mutter about mysterious shadows. For story-rich entries, treat them as rumors, clues, or hooks, not definitive truth—unless you want them to be.
    Examples:
    - A bard in the inn shares “A haunting melody...” and offers to perform it—players might hear the tune themselves later.
    - A local elder rants about “Theories about the graveyard soil...” sparking a spooky side quest.
    - A caravan guard grumbles about “Shifting political alliances,” hinting at tension the players can investigate.
