We don’t know where the target is
Target is always moving, unpredictable
Sensitive third party getting involved
Divided opinions. Enemy needed/justified
Got competition, be careful, stop them
Background problem actively in your way
Lack of loyalty, trust, or confidence in you
Rough beginning, start at a disadvantage
Family member involved (is it your own?)
We are still missing some names
Too many uncertainties, stay low profile
No killings (at least no innocent’s lives)
We know where, but hard to get there
Transport or travel routes compromised
Someone powerful is behind everything
Legendary enemy allied to their cause
Hazardous location conditions or traps
Unknown vulnerabilities, needs intel
We aren’t ready yet. Needs preparation
We are under time pressure or limit
